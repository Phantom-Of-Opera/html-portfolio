<h2>Three movies that I really liked</h2>
<p>(and so much more that I loved...)</p>
<hr />
<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Itineraire d'un enfant gate</h3>
        <p>A great movie about the importance of not losing itself in life and always be aware that we can change
            anything if we
            really want it</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Aliens</h3>
        <p>A very classic set of movies that walk the fine line of keeping you on the edge of your seat while asking a
            few good
            questions about ourselves</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Love Actually</h3>
        <p>A brilliant british comedy full of humor and feelings. A classic but a very good moment to spend with these
            characters stories</p>
    </li>
